## Project 4, FYS3150
Contains:
- IsingModel.cpp, a class based implementation of the Ising Model in 2D
- unit_tests.cpp, a file containing unit tests, verifying Ising model class against 2x2 lattice, analytical values.
- parallel_ising.cpp, a parallel version of the Ising model, uses the class construct to averages as function of temperature.
- plot_device.py, a python file for plotting results.
- data_analysis.cpp, file for generating data for 20x20 Ising model.
- Makefile for ease of compilation.
